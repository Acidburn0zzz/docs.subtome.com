[Christian Weiske](http://cweiske.de/) just [created a nice little TT-RSS plugin](http://cweiske.de/tagebuch/tt-rss-subtome.htm) for SubTome! If you use this standalone feed reader, I recommand you add the pluginn because it makes it really easy and simple to follow new feeds!

>  I use Tiny Tiny RSS for reading feeds, and I want feed subscription to be as easy as possible. My new SubToMe plugin for Tiny Tiny RSS allows you to register your TT-RSS instance at subtome.com, making feed subscriptions a two-click process.
