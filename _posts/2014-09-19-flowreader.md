[FlowReader](http://flowreader.com) is a web-based personal news reader that offers a new way to browse online content, combining RSS feeds along with links and stories shared on Facebook and Twitter. 

You can combine your Facebook, Twitter and Google account to extract content from all of them and then categorize, filter and read what you care about most. This is very handy!

From today, if you're a FlowReader user, everytime you'll see a SubToMe button, like on a [Feedbuner feed](/2014/04/13/subtome-in-feedburner/), for example, you'll be redirected to FlowReader!
