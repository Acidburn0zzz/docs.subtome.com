If you've ever visited a Wordpress.com hosted blog, you've probably noticed that there are multiple buttons to follow that blog by email or using the [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com/) reader. Now, if your blog is not hosted on Wordpress, you can easily [add a SubToMe button](http://docs.subtome.com/publishers/) to your site so that more people follow it from their wordpress reader!

Similarly, if you use the Wordpress reader to follow your favorite sources of content online, you should add the [SubToMe bookmarklet](https://www.subtome.com/#/settings) (or the [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/subtome/cjkhnlmkkfheepafpgppmpdahbjgkjfc?hl=en) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/subtome-subscribe-button/) addons) so that you can easily add our favorite sites to follow!

And for those who wonder, yes, this happened at the [Reboot RSS workshop](http://docs.subtome.com/2014/05/21/reboot-rss/)! Our community can get so much done, much faster, when we know each other! 

Happy following!
