Earlier this week, SubToMe has been added to Feedburner! Feedburner is still an incredibly popular RSS feed platform which provides analytics and landing pages for RSS feed owners. It has not been getting a lot of attention form Google since they aquire it, but people still use it.

If you're using Feedburner, make sure you allow SubToMe as one of the mechanisms to subscribe to the feed by going to [Feedburner's home page](http://feedburner.google.com/). Then, in the **Optimize Menu**, pick **BrowserFriendly** and click on the **Appearance** option link. Make sure SubToMe is selected :)

Check the integration on these feeds for example: [Indepthafrica](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Indepthafrica), [CanadianSecurity](http://feeds.feedburner.com/CanadianSecurity) or [Phase108](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Phase108)

This is anamzing piece of news, but don't forget that if you integrate a SubToMe buton directly into your site, you'll get subscription stats, and you can style it in any way you like. Of course *SubToMe works really well with any feed*, including your Feedburner feed! This is all completely transparent to the user.

Happy subscribing!
